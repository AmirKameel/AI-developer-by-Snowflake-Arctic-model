Welcome to the AI Fullstack Developer project! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive environment for data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and interaction with Snowflake Arctic, an intelligent language model. Below is a guide on how to use the different functionalities of this project.

# Features
Data Analysis: Upload datasets, explore data statistics, and preprocess data with various options such as handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Data Visualization: Visualize data through correlation heatmaps, pairplots, histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to gain insights into the dataset.

Machine Learning: Train regression or classification models with options to fine-tune model parameters and evaluate model performance.

Snowflake Arctic Interaction: Interact with Snowflake Arctic, a powerful language model, by providing dataset features and queries to generate intelligent responses.
Getting Started
